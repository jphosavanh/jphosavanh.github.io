European Journal of Operational Research, 321(3), 734–749. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejor.2024.09.042.\n\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nBibTeX\n\n\n\n\nWe study single-machine scheduling problems with step-learning, where an improvement in processing time is experienced if a job is started at, or after, a job-dependent learning-date. We consider minimizing two functions: the number of late jobs and the total late work, and we show that when at least a common due-date or common learning-date is assumed, the problem is \\(\\mathcal{NP}\\)-hard in the ordinary sense; however, when both are arbitrary, the problem becomes strongly \\(\\mathcal{NP}\\)-hard. For each of the problems where at least one of the dates is assumed to be common, we analyze the structure of an optimal job schedule with and without idle time and propose pseudo-polynomial time dynamic programming algorithms. We also show that the problem of minimizing the weighted number of late jobs with step-learning can be solved with a minor change to the algorithms for the unweighted case. In addition to this, we show that when a common due-date is assumed and no idle time is allowed, the problem of minimizing the total late work is equivalent to that of minimizing the makespan. Furthermore, we provide a more efficient algorithm to solve the problem of minimizing makespan under the assumption of a common learning-date than the one in the existing literature. Lastly, we show that our analysis can also be applied to the case of step-deterioration, where instead, the processing times of jobs increase at a given date.\n\n\n\n\n@article{PhosavanhOron2025,\ntitle = {Minimizing the number of late jobs and total late work with step-learning},\njournal = {European Journal of Operational Research},\nyear = {2025},\nissn = {0377-2217},\nvolume = {321},\nnumber = {3},\npages = {734-749},\ndoi = {10.1016/j.ejor.2024.09.042},\nauthor = {Johnson Phosavanh and Daniel Oron},\nkeywords = {Scheduling, Single-machine, Step-learning, Dynamic programming},\n}\n\n\nPhosavanh J., Oron, D.

Classical scheduling models assume that job processing times remain constant over time; however, in real-world settings, processing times may change due to factors such as technological upgrades or machine maintenance. We complement this with the notion of multiple independent agents competing over the use of a shared resource, each with their own motives. These considerations allow us to model the upcoming trend of the sharing economy, where resources are shared amongst independent competitors in the market. We aim to model these scenarios by considering a variety of scheduling criteria for each agent, including the makespan, the number of late jobs, and the total late work. To account for the change in processing times, we consider an optional rate-modifying activity that once completed, results in a reduction in subsequent job processing times. We show that problems involving the total late work are binary \\(\\mathcal{NP}\\)-hard and propose efficient pseudo-polynomial dynamic programming algorithms for solving these problems. We also show that the remaining problems are solvable in polynomial time.\n\n\n\n\n@article{PhosavanhOron2024,\ntitle = {Two-agent single-machine scheduling with a rate-modifying activity},\njournal = {European Journal of Operational Research},\nyear = {2024},\nvolume = {312},\npages = {866-876},\nnumber = {3},\nissn = {0377-2217},\ndoi = {10.1016/j.ejor.2023.08.002},\nauthor = {Johnson Phosavanh and Daniel Oron},\nkeywords = {Scheduling, Single machine, Two-agents, Dynamic programming},\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nArticles under review\n\nPhosavanh J., Matsypura, D. (2025). Centrality of shortest paths: algorithms and complexity results. Submitted to the INFORMS Journal on Computing (1st round R&R).\n\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\n\n\nThe centrality of a node is often used to measure its importance to the structure of a network. Some centrality measures can be extended to measure the importance of a path. In this paper, we consider the problem of finding the most central shortest path. We show that the computational complexity of this problem depends on the measure of centrality used and, in the case of degree centrality, whether the network is weighted or not. We develop a polynomial algorithm for the most degree-central shortest path problem with the worst-case running time of \\(O(|E||V|^2\\Delta(G))\\), where \\(|V|\\) is the number of vertices in the network, \\(|E|\\) is the number of edges in the network, and \\(\\Delta(G)\\) is the maximum degree of the graph. In addition, we show that the same problem is NP-hard on a weighted graph. Furthermore, we show that the problem of finding the most betweenness-central shortest path is solvable in polynomial time, while finding the most closeness-central shortest path is NP-hard, regardless of whether the graph is weighted or not. We also develop an algorithm for finding the most betweenness-central shortest path with a running time of \\(O(|E|^2|V|^2)\\) on both weighted and unweighted graphs. To conclude our paper, we conduct a numerical study of our algorithms on synthetic and real-world networks and compare our results to the existing literature.\n\n\n\nPhosavanh J., Oron, D. (2025). Minimizing total weighted late work with step-learning on a single machine. Submitted to Discrete Applied Mathematics (1st round R&R).\n\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\n\n\nWe study single-machine scheduling problems with step-learning to minimize the total weighted late work. Step-learning is a mechanism that allows jobs to be completed more efficiently if started after a job-dependent learning-date. We show that this problem is strongly \\(\\mathcal{NP}\\)-hard when both learning-dates and due-dates are arbitrary, but when at least one is assumed to be the same for all jobs, the problem is \\(\\mathcal{NP}\\)-hard in the ordinary sense, and we provide pseudo-polynomial algorithms for these cases.\n\n\n\nPhosavanh J., Oron, D.

We start with the single-agent problem of minimizing the total weighted late work and then extend the results over to two-agent problems involving combinations of the weighted number of late jobs and the total weighted late work. We examine the properties of optimal schedules and provide efficient pseudo-polynomial time algorithms to solve these problems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConferences\n\nPhosavanh J., Oron, D.
